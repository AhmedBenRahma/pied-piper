# 🔍 Pied Piper AI - Fraud Detection System

> **Winner Solution for EY x Dauphine Hackathon**  
> Detecting Organized Fraud Rings with Graph Neural Networks & Agentic AI

## 🎯 Overview

Pied Piper AI is an advanced fraud detection system for insurance claims that uses Graph Neural Networks (GNN) and Agentic AI to detect **Organized Fraud Rings** that traditional rule-based systems miss.

### The Problem
Standard insurance fraud detection relies on rule-based systems that check isolated claims. They miss **collusion patterns** where multiple entities work together to commit fraud systematically.

### Our Solution
By representing insurance claims as a **network graph**, we can use advanced graph algorithms to detect:
- **Star Topologies**: Hub-based collusion (e.g., corrupt doctor + multiple patients)
- **Circular Patterns**: Staged accident loops
- **Dense Cliques**: Mutual collusion networks

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone or navigate to the project directory
cd Pied Piper-ai

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the Application

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Data Generation (`data_generator.py`)
- Generates **500 normal insurance claims** with random associations
- Injects **2 specific fraud rings**:
  - **Ring A (Spider Web)**: 1 corrupt doctor + 1 corrupt pharmacy + 20 patients
  - **Ring B (Car Crash Loop)**: 5 car owners in circular collision pattern

### 2. Graph Analysis (`graph_logic.py`)
Uses NetworkX to apply graph algorithms:
- **Community Detection** (Louvain algorithm): Identifies tightly-knit groups
- **Degree Centrality**: Finds highly connected hub nodes
- **Clustering Coefficient**: Detects closed loops and star topologies
- **Risk Scoring**: Combines metrics to assign 0-100 risk scores

### 3. Dashboard (`app.py`)
Professional Streamlit interface featuring:
- **📊 Metrics Sidebar**: Total claims, value, fraud rings detected
- **🌐 Interactive Graph**: PyVis physics-based visualization
  - 🔴 Red nodes = High risk fraud
  - 🟠 Orange nodes = Medium risk
  - 🔵 Blue nodes = Normal
- **🤖 AI Agent Reports**: Explains detected patterns with confidence scores

## 🎨 Key Features

✅ **Interactive Visualization**: Drag, zoom, and explore the fraud network  
✅ **Real-time Detection**: Instant fraud ring identification  
✅ **AI-Powered Explanations**: Automated analysis reports  
✅ **Color-Coded Risk Levels**: Visual fraud indicators
